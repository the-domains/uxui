            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Drink to Dublin: Jameson enlist artist James Earley to design new label.</h1><p>Any visitor to Dublin's fair city will quickly sense the iconic presence of Jameson whiskey, which is woven into the fabric of life in Ireland's capital. The brand began producing whiskey in Dublin in 1780, and has always been closely linked with the city's rich cultural scene, championing its music, literature, and art.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/16455e4742acf25a3370643f60034b3fa72e36d7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Livestream's Mevo camera lets you edit video on the fly</h1><p>My first thought upon hearing about the camera, which was officially introduced at Facebook's F8 conference earlier this week, was: Who exactly is Livestream targeting here? Facebook Live video has boomed in a big way with people shooting on their phones, and lots of those users aren't going to shell out for a $399 external camera.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4466be094e86bad9c0e2fe4c5a74c3d32ef5c016.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Light's L16 Pocket-Sized Multi-Aperture Camera</h1><p>No other camera looks quite like the newly announced Light L16, with one side featuring a whopping 16 lenses. This visual assessment immediately reveals just how advanced the technology is within the device. When capturing an image, all lenses fire at different focal lengths and a computational software within the camera assembles them to maximize every pixel.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3a15091274eec7069ecc73315c0d0bf176c8c5ea.jpg"></article>]]></description>
